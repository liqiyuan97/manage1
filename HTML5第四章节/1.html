    <p>Three competing store owners rented adjoining shops in a mall. Observers waited for mayhem to ensue.</p>
    <p>The retailer on the right put up huge signs saying, "Gigantic Sale!" and "Super Bargains!"</p>

    <h2>Midway</h2>
    <p>The store on the left <span>raised bigger</span> signs proclaiming, "Prices Slashed!" and "Fantastic Discounts!"</p>

    <h3>Tactics</h3> 
    <p>The owner in the middle then prepared a large sign that simply stated, "ENTRANCE".</p>
